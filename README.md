## Preface

OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) is the next generation solution compared to OPC Classic. One of the most important improvements in OPC UA is a powerful Address Space and Information Model concept. OPC UA allows exposing real-time process data and underlying infrastructure as a consistent information model built up with nodes. The process model is represented by nodes, attributes, and their mutual relationships. Therefore, using OPC UA this powerful concept allows us to expose not only raw process data but also entire consistent information about the process state and behavior. The flexibility of the OPC UA ensures that no existing or future systems are too complex to be exposed via OPC UA. Of course, such flexibility leads to difficulties during design, development, and deployment, thatâ€™s why the Object Oriented-Internet Address Space Model Designer (ASMD) was born.

The  OOI ASMD supports the graphical design of the process model using OPC UA Information and Address Space concepts. The embedded model compiler may be used to generate all required file formats necessary to deploy custom models on the client, server, publisher and subscriber side using any existing Software Development Kit. It is compliant with the OPC UA Specifications [OPC UA Part 3][Opc.UA.Part3], [OPC UA Part 5][Opc.UA.Part5], and [OPC UA Part 6][Opc.UA.Part6]. By design, it is also a consistent part of the broader concept [Object-Oriented Internet](https://commsvr.gitbook.io/ooi/).

> **NOTE**:
>
>- The design, development and deployment of the OPC UA Information Model detailed description is covered by the document [Information Models Development][IMD].
>- The help documentation is now available at [OPC UA Address Space Model Designer Online Help][github.MD]

I am a researcher who is passionate about applying knowledge and experience in building a machine-centric global village. Let's build it with you and for you. To join our effort and create an organization context I have launched the [**Object-Oriented Internet Partnership Program**](https://github.commsvr.com/AboutPartnershipProgram.md.html).

> Consider joining as a sponsor, contributor or end-user. Details are covered by the section [**How to be involved**](https://github.commsvr.com/AboutPartnershipProgram.md.html#how-to-be-involved)

> Your participation is needed to make sure the work will continue as expected.

## Releases

The ASMD was written by CAS Lodz Poland. I am the founder and Executive Director of CAS. Now CAS is just an individual business activity conducted by me, so I decided to move this software to Open Source.

We use [Semantic Versioning][SV] for versioning. For the versions available, see the [releases on this repository][REL]. For your convenience, the versions of the repository, tools and NuGet packages has been listed in the next subsections.

## Getting Started

This section describes prerequisites to use the tool, compile the code and run unit tests.

### Ho to Install

Download and run the file `UA.ModelDesigner.exe` to unzip the content to the selected folder and create an icon on the desktop. The application will run after unpacking. To restart the application you may use the icon on the desktop or double click the application file `<target>\UA.ModelDesigner\OOI.UA.ModelDesigner.exe`, where \<target\> is the already selected folder during the installation. To uninstall the software and embedded example simply delete the \<target\> folder and the icon.

> Note: The self-extracting zip file and the main application is not code-signed. The unsigned executable maybe not allowed by your company IT policy. The installer package containing signed stuff is on the project road map #89. Further development planning is based on the sponsors' priorities.

### How to open an example

This section contains information about the Address Space Model Designer sample solutions that illustrate the structure and techniques used for designing models and defining bindings between model nodes and real-time process data.

The section [Information Models Development][IMD] of the online ebook covers details on how to get started using the attached examples. The solution `BoilerExampleSolution` contains a boiler model. This model is described in the [ReferenceApplication Producer - Boilers Set Simulator][boiler]. Check out the section [Companion Specification - Information Model for Analyzers][ADI] to get more about `ADIExempleSolution` example.

Selected examples is added to the folder `<target>\UA.ModelDesigner\EmbeddedExample`. The following step by step instruction will guide you on how to open the examples.

- The folder `EmbeddedExample` contains two examples
  - `BoilerExampleSolution` - a set of unmanned boilers spread geographically, which have to be monitored and remotely controlled
  - `ADIExempleSolution` - a set of models to be used as an example of adopting companion standard models, i.e. [analyzer devices integration][ADI]
- Now you may run the ASMD application and open the selected solution

You can open the solution into ASMD in the following way:

1. Click on the main menu Open item
1. Select the directory containing the sample solution
1. Open the `BoilerExampleSolution.uamdsl` file
1. Click on the confirmation (Open) button

### How to build and run the unit tests in Visual Studio on Windows

Projects can be opened in Visual Studio 2017. Support for some projects depends on the Visual Studio edition and installed components.

1. Open the `CommServer.UA.ModelDesigner.sln` solution file using Visual Studio 2017.
1. Hit `F6` to build all projects in the solution.
1. Set the `ModelDesigner.DesignStudio` as the Start-up Project
1. Press `F5` to run the tool using Debug configuration
1. Hit `Ctrl+r,Ctrl+a` to run all unit tests

The list of packages used is listed on the page [Dependency graph][DEPGraph] of this repository. All packages are included in this GitHub repository in the local folder `_nugets` or published on NuGet. The local folder is configured in the `NuGet.Config`. The NuGet Gallery is the public package repository used by all package authors and consumers. All required packages are loaded before the build.

### Object Oriented Internet

In this umbrella project, C\# deliverables supporting a new Machine To Machine \(M2M\) communication approach based on the **Data-Oriented Architecture** (DOA) paradigm is to be researched. The goal is to provide a generic solution for publishing and updating information in a context that can be used to describe and discover it by software applications. It is implemented based on the

- [OPC Unified Architecture](http://goo.gl/y4EHUn) - an industrial integration standard that fulfills the proposed architecture requirements.
- Object-Oriented Programming - well know and widely accepted programming language model in which data processing is organized around 4 major principles, namely encapsulation, abstraction, polymorphism and inheritance.

The GitHub [Object Oriented Internet][OOI] repository is aimed at the maintenance of this project. The ASMD contributes to this project and is compliant with the OOI concept.

### CommServer

[CommServer][commserver] is a package of software to manage data transfer using OPC standards. Built-in technologies and algorithms support Machine to Machine (M2M) meaningful interoperability. The [CommServer][commserver] was written by CAS Lodz Poland.

The GitHub repository [commsvr-com/migration2os][migration2os] is aimed at the `CommServer` software migration from on-premise subversion repository to GitHub and publishing it as the Open-Source Software (OSS). The members of the `CommServer` family are to be converged with the Object-Oriented Internet paradigms and integrated with the solutions maintained in this repository.

The project [CommServer Migration to Open-source][migration2osProj] will be used to coordinate the migration process of transferring multi-parts software from an on-premise subversion repository to a set of GitHub repositories.

### Object Oriented Internet Reactive Networking Configuration Editor

OPC-UA-OOI.ConfigEditor is a package of software to manage the configuration of the [Reactive Communication][OOIBookToC].  The `OPC-UA-OOI.ConfigEditor` was written by CAS Lodz Poland. The [mpostol/OPC-UA-OOI.ConfigEditor][ConfigEditor] repository is aimed at the software migration from on-premise subversion repository to GitHub and publishing it as the Open-Source Software (OSS).  After migration, this repository will be used to manage all activities addressing the software maintenance process as a plug-in of the ASMD.
