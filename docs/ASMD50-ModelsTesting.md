# OPC UA Information Models Compliance Testing

Let me inform you about the opportunity to test your custom OPC UA Information Models against the specification for free. Now I am working on the new release of the Address Space Model Designer, and I have commenced the testing process. Therefore I will appreciate the possibility to test the tool against your custom model and by the way the models against the specification, namely Part 3 and Part 5. Contact me if you have any models that can be made available to me for this purpose?

The model tests will be conducted in the Public Domain, so I will accept only models protected by a permissible license without requirements about how they can be modified or redistributed. The ASMD project is licensed under the terms of the MIT license. For each accepted for testing models, I will create an independent issue, and you will be able to trace the testing progress. The ASMD is free (published under the MIT license) open-source tool that supports the graphical design of the process model using OPC UA Information and Address Space concepts. The embedded model compiler generates all required file formats necessary to deploy custom models on the client, server, publisher, and subscriber side using any existing Software Development Kit. The software has also embedded model validation and documentation generation functionality.

The preliminary list of tests is as follows.

```TXT

[ ] possibility to open ModelDesign file
[ ] possibility to import NodeSet file
[ ] possibility to convert NodeSet to ModelDesign
[ ] possibility to compile ModelDesign and generate NodeSet file
[ ] validation against the schema and compliance with the specification (Part 3 and Part 5) of the NodeSet file
[ ] correct generation of the model documentation in MS Word format
[ ] correct generation of website content with the model documentation

```

> NOTES:
>
> - MS Word documentation will be available for the model owner
> - website will be publicly available and published using GitHub pages
> - any models inconsistency will be discussed with the model owner
